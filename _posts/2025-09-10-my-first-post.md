 Hey guys! This is Remyâ€”welcome to my blog ðŸ’«
 
It took me a while to post this because I was stuck in the too many ideas phase, but Iâ€™m glad itâ€™s finally out. So, let me introduce myself: Iâ€™m Remy, 17 years old, and honestly? I love a lot of thingsâ€”dancing, programming, learning Korean, calisthenics, volleyball, guitar, judoâ€¦ and thatâ€™s just the short list.

The reason I started this blog is because I felt like there wasnâ€™t really a space for girls and women like meâ€”masc women who have their own mix of goals and dreams. Itâ€™s not about doing things differently than everyone else, but about having a place where we can just be ourselves, feel included, and support each other while working toward our goals.

I donâ€™t know if anyone will read this now (or ever), but Iâ€™m proud of myself for putting it out there and giving it a shot. If youâ€™re a woman who wants to get stronger, be productive, learn more, or even just follow along with my progressâ€”stick around. Letâ€™s grow together.
Thatâ€™s it for today, wonderful people. Bye bye ðŸ’œ
