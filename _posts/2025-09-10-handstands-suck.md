Hey guys! This is Remy—welcome back to my blog ✨

So, for the past few months I’ve been trying to learn the handstand, and let me tell you—it’s been a disaster. I fell on my knee twice (yep, same knee). The bruise from round two isn’t even fully healed yet.
Most of my “training” was just wall walks, and those things are brutal. Shifting your entire bodyweight from one arm to another? Not fun. Four months in, and I had basically zero progress.

But here’s the thing: instead of repeating the same routine and expecting magic, I’m switching it up. 
Daily practice is the plan—because consistency beats everything. Here’s my new 10-day routine:

Hollow body hold (60 seconds)
Frog hold (60 seconds)
Scapular push-ups (20 reps)

I’ll come back and share my progress after sticking with it.
Handstands might suck now, but honestly, that’s what’s going to make the victory taste even sweeter when I finally nail it.

That’s it for today, wonderful people. Bye bye 💜
